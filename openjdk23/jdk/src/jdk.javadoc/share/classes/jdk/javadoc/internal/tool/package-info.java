/**
 * Provides the front end for the javadoc tool.
 *
 * <p>The main entry points are in {@link jdk.javadoc.internal.tool.Main}
 * which calls the (poorly-named) {@link jdk.javadoc.internal.tool.Start}
 * which provides the overall functionality of the tool.
 *
 * <p>The classes provide a framework for processing command-line options
 * and determining the set of elements (modules, packages, types and members)
 * to be documented.
 *
 * <p>The classes also provide the means to use the javac front end to read
 * source files, including the documentation comments.
 *
 * <p>Finally, once the appropriate files have been read, the classes invoke
 * the selected doclet to process those files, typically to generate API
 * documentation.
